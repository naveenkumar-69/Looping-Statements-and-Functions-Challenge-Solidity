In this contract, the add function takes two uint256 parameters, a and b, and returns their sum (a + b).

The subtract function also takes two uint256 parameters, a and b, and returns their difference (a - b). However, it includes a require statement to check that b is less than or equal to a to avoid a subtraction error. If b is greater than a, it throws an error with a custom message.

The multiply function multiplies two uint256 parameters, a and b, and returns their product (a * b).

The divide function divides a by b and returns the result (a / b). It includes a require statement to check that b is greater than zero to avoid a division by zero error. If b is zero, it throws an error with a custom message.
